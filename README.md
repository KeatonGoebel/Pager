# Pager
Pager is a C++ implentation of a paging simulation program. It was written in the fall semester of my senior year for Translyvania University. It was also a group project written with two other people. Paging is the process where the operating system seperates process into pages and physical memory into fixed-size blocks called frames. When a process is executed, the pages representing the process will be mapped onto one or more frames representing physical memory. Because the operating system keeps track of what pages correspond to what frames with a page table, this process allows the operating system to translate logical memory addresses into physical memory. Paging allows for there to be noncontingous allocation of physical memory. Because the frames can be stored anywhere in memory, memory can be used much more efficiently.
